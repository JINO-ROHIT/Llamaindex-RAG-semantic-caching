# Semantic Caching for RAG


This repository contains a simple semantic caching implementation to save RAG costs and speed by 10x. It makes use of FAISS index and a simple json cache to store queries and responses.

## Quick Start

To run the caching pipeline:

    ```bash
    python caching.py
    ```
